# üó∫Ô∏è PCGis: Procedural GIS Data Loader for Unreal Engine & Cesium

**Bridge the gap between Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and high-fidelity Unreal Engine worlds.** PCGis is a powerful plugin that seamlessly imports real-world GIS data from Shapefiles and procedurally generates vast, dynamic landscapes directly onto Cesium's global 3D terrain.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Dual Data Type Support:** Effortlessly handle both **Point Data** (for placing specific assets like buildings, trees, and rocks) and **Polygon Data** (for procedural generation of forests, foliage, and other area-based content).
*   **Seamless Cesium Integration:** Automatically clamps all spawned assets and procedural points to the Cesium terrain, whether you're using Cesium ion's streaming terrain or Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles.
*   **Procedural Content Generation (PCG) Powered:** Leverages Unreal Engine 5's powerful PCG framework to generate millions of instances with complex rules, all perfectly aligned to the real-world terrain.
*   **Smart SQLite Caching System:** A custom-built caching layer stores generated point data. On subsequent loads, data is read from the cache for near-instantaneous regeneration, eliminating costly re-processing and stabilizing frame rates.
*   **High-Performance Runtime Generation:** Utilizes Unreal Engine's Hierarchical Instanced Static Mesh (HISM) components for optimal performance, allowing you to render millions of procedurally placed objects efficiently.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Manages the heavy lifting of terrain height sampling asynchronously to prevent engine lock-ups, providing a smoother user experience during initial processing.

## üöÄ How It Works

PCGis operates through an intelligent, two-stage pipeline designed for both flexibility and performance.

### Stage 1: Initial Processing & Caching (On Data Change)
1.  **Data Ingestion:** Loads `.shp` Shapefiles containing your Point or Polygon data.
2.  **Point Processing (For Polygons):** For polygon data, a custom PCG node samples the interior based on density attributes and uses Cesium's `SampleHeightMostDetailed` function to clamp each point to the terrain.
3.  **SQLite Cache Population:** The calculated world positions (georeferenced) for all points are stored in a local SQLite database. This one-time process ensures future loads are lightning-fast.

### Stage 2: High-Performance Runtime Generation
1.  **Cache Check:** On load, the plugin checks if the source Shapefile is unmodified.
2.  **Database-Driven Spawning:** If a cache exists, it bypasses heavy computation and reads the pre-calculated points directly from the SQLite database.
3.  **Efficient Actor Spawning:** Spawns actors with PCG components that use the cached data to populate the scene with Hierarchical Instanced Static Meshes, resulting in minimal performance impact and buttery-smooth frame rates.

*   A Cesium ion account (for terrain/imagery)

### Installation
1.  Clone this repository into your project's `Plugins` folder.
2.  Rebuild your project in Visual Studio or Xcode.
3.  Launch the editor and ensure `PCGis` is enabled in the Plugins list.

### Quick Start
1.  **Add a PCGis Manager** actor to your level.
2.  **Configure your Cesium Georeference.**
3.  **For Point Data:**
    *   Provide the path to your Point Shapefile.
    *   Map model names from the attribute table to Unreal Static Meshes.
4.  **For Polygon Data:**
    *   Provide the path to your Polygon Shapefile.
    *   Assign a PCG Graph that uses the included `PCG Cesium Clamp` node.
    *   Define density and other parameters.
